    "Selecting the right PDB file is a crucial first step in structure-based drug design. The choice should align with the specific goals of your research. When navigating the Protein Data Bank, which houses a myriad of protein structures, consider the following to ensure the relevance and accuracy of your simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations for Selecting a PDB File\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Species Relevance:\n",
    "- Preferably choose a structure derived from the species that your research is targeting, typically human. This ensures that the sequences and structural features are representative of your biological system of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Alignment:\n",
    "- If your study involves correlating computational data with experimental data, such as binding kinetics of enzyme activity assays, it's crucial that the protein structure reflects the system used in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ligand Consideration:\n",
    "- The presence and relevance of a bound ligand can significantly impact your research. If your study focuses on a particular ligand or a specific binding site, ensure that the PDB file includes a structure with the ligand bound to the correct site.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will choose T4-Lysozyme, bound with a toluene (as ligand).\n"
