# System Preparation in Molecular Dynamics: Targeting ALK Kinases for Lung Cancer

This directory contains resources and guidelines for system preparation in molecular dynamics (MD), specifically targeting ALK kinases in the context of lung cancer drug design. The process outlined here is crucial for anyone looking to understand the structural and functional aspects of ALK kinases, which are significant in the development of therapeutic strategies for lung cancer.

## Overview

Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in several types of lung cancers. Abnormal ALK genes can lead to the development of cancer by promoting cell growth and proliferation. Targeting ALK kinases has become a promising strategy in lung cancer treatment, making it a critical area of study in computational drug design.

## Steps in System Preparation

### 1. Identify Your Target
   - **Target**: ALK kinases indicated in lung cancer.
   - **Objective**: Understand the structural basis of ALK kinase activity and its role in cancer progression.

### 2. Choose and Visualize Your PDB File
   #### 2.1. Analyze the Protein Structure
   - Examine the crystal structure for gaps or mutations.
   - Look for engineered residues by checking for "ENGINEE" or "MUTATE" in the PDB file.

   #### 2.2. Addressing Structural Gaps
   - If gaps are present, utilize homology modeling.
   - **Tools Used**: SWISS-MODEL (alternative options include MODELLER, MOE, I-TASSER).
   - **Quality Check**: Employ a Ramachandran Plot to assess the model's quality.

   #### 2.3. Download and Proceed
   - Download the refined model for further system preparation.

### 3. System Preparation with Amber and GAFF Force Field
   #### 3.1. Using Gromacs
   - Details and resources for system preparation using Gromacs.

   #### 3.2. Using OpenMM
   - Guidelines on system setup with OpenMM.

   #### 3.3. Using NAMD
   - Instructions for employing NAMD in system preparation (Note: Amber package is excluded to focus on open-source resources).
